# kaggle-iceberg
These are the jupyter notebooks I used during the Statoil/C-Core iceberg classification competition on Kaggle.  
This project is also part of the works I've done on my graduate project for the master's degree in Peking University.  
The original data are too large for GitHub. So I store them in [baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c5386Nmka0R1FjYA1BILaA)  key: kyma.
The notebooks are listed in the order we sloved the problem.
* 1_Data_visualization_and_exploratory_analysis deals with data visualization and exploratory analysis.
* 2_VGG16_Transfer_Model deals with the transfer learning based on vgg model.
* 3_create_new_features deals with the feature generation.
* 4_logistic_xgboost deals with the models on the new features.

The weights of the CNN model are stored [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/176OJguzh2JrtPvG4yFdW7g) key: x9hp  

My best result is stored in submission_best.csv
